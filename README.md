## Please note this is my first proper Github-Project, so any advice is welcome! (no matter if for the code or the github-repository)
- If deepth is more than 1 it gets a little buggy, but IÂ´m gonna fix that (1 is default)
- Needs quite a lot of RAM (not just firefox, but also the script as the friendslist/deepth gets huge)
